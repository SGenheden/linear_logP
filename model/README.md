# Models for predicting water/octanol partition coefficients

The project created two models for predicting partition coefficients

1. A simple OLS model with 8 explanatory variables, R studio notebook available in `ols.Rmd`

2. A two-step model, based on a logistic regression to predict the sign + 2 OLS models to predict the partition coefficient, R studio notebook available in `logistic.Rmd`
